# Concurrent Timers
Ever wanted to manage your time better, a way to truly map and measure the sequential and parallel flow of time? Introducing Concurrent Timers! In all reality this is simply a visually pleasing and very intuitive way to manage your time with timers. You can create timers along the x and y axis. Timers within the x axis run sequentially, and they run in parallel within the y axis.
